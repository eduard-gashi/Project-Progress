### History
C was invented at Bell Labs by computer scientist Dennis Ritchie in 1972. Its purpose was to create a more powerful and portable programming language for developing the Unix operating system.
Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson played key roles in the development of Unix and the C language and they even won the Turing Award.


### Compiling, Debugging and Running Programs
#### Compiler
- GNU (GNU's Not Unix) is the standard compiler for C.
- It checks the code for syntax errors. If it finds any it aborts the process and shows the error message.
- An executable file named a.out is created when you run the following commando:
    gcc gnu sample.c
- In order to give your script another name you can run:
    gcc -o sample.exe sample.c
- Install gcc on Windows by installing MinGW-w64


#### Editors
- vi, vim: Powerful but complex text-based editors that you run directly in the terminal.
- notepad: Simple text editor in Windows
- Sublime Text: A fast and lightweight code editor that's popular with many developers.

#### Debugging
- Clang is the standard Debugger for C++
